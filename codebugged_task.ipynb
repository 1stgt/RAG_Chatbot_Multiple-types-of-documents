You have alreadystudied about water in Class VII. Is watera limitless resource?In the light of the availability ofvarious resources in nature, naturalresources can be broadly classifiedinto two kinds:Inexhaustible Natural ResourcesThese resources are present in unlimitedquantity in nature and are not likely tobe exhausted by human activities.Examples are: sunlight, air.Exhaustible Natural ResourcesThe amount of these resources innature is limited. They can beexhausted by human activities.Examples of these resources are forests,wildlife, minerals, coal, petroleum,natural gas etc.Activity 5.2It is a group activityTake some containers. Fill themwith  popcorn/peanuts/roastedgram/toffees. Divide students intogroups of seven each. Further divideeach group into three subgroupscontaining 1, 2 and 4 students.Label them as first, second andthird generation respectively. TheseWe use various materials for ourbasic needs. Some of them arefound in nature and somehave been made by human efforts.Activity 5.1Make a list of various materials usedby us in daily life and classify themas natural and man-made.NaturalMan-madeCan we use all ournatural resourcesforever ?Does this list include air, water, soiland minerals? Since all these areobtained from nature, they are callednatural resources.© NCERTnot to be republishedsub-groups represent theconsumers. As population isgrowing, second and thirdgenerations have larger number ofconsumers.Put one full container for eachgroup on a table. Ask consumers ofthe first generation from each groupto consume eatables from thecontainer of their group. Now, askthe second generation consumersfrom each group to do the same. Askstudents to observe carefully theavailability of eatables in eachcontainer. If some thing is left in thecontainers, ask third generationfrom each group to consume it. Now,finally observe whether all theconsumers of the third generationgot the eatables or not. Also observeif any thing is still left in any of thecontainers.Assume that the eatables in thecontainer represent the totalavailability of an exhausible naturalresource like coal, petroleum ornatural gas. Each group may havedifferent consumption pattern. Arethe earlier generations of any grouptoo greedy?  It may be that the earliergenerations in some groups wereconcerned about the cominggeneration(s) and left something forthem.In this chapter we will learn aboutsome exhaustible natural resourceslike coal, petroleum and natural gas.These were formed from the deadremains of living organisms (fossils).So, these are all known as fossilfuels.5.1 CoalYou may have seen coal, or heard aboutit (Fig. 5.1). It is as hard as stone and isblack in colour.Fig. 5.1: CoalCoal is one of the fuels used to cookfood. Earlier, it was used in railwayengines to produce steam to run theengine. It is also used in thermal powerplants to produce electricity. Coal is alsoused as a fuel in various industries.Story of CoalWhere do we getcoal from and howis it formed?About 300 million years ago theearth had dense forests in low lyingwetland areas. Due to natural processes,like flooding, these forests got buriedunder the soil. As more soil depositedover them, they were compressed. Thetemperature also rose as they sankdeeper and deeper. Under high pressureand high temperature, dead plants gotslowly converted to coal. As coalcontains mainly carbon, the slowprocess of conversion of dead vegetationinto coal is called carbonisation. Sinceit was formed from the remains ofvegetation, coal is also called a fossil fuel.A coal mine is shown in Fig. 5.2.COAL AND PETROLEUM57© NCERTnot to be republishedSCIENCE58Fig. 5.2: A coal mineC. Coal gasCoal gas is obtained during theprocessing of coal to get coke. It is usedCoal gas was used for street lightingfor the first time in London in 1810and in New York around 1820. Now adays, it is used as a source of heatrather than light.These days, bitumen, a petroleumproduct, is used in place of coal-tarfor metalling the roads.Fig. 5.3: Coal-tarWhen heated in air, coalburns and produces mainly carbondioxide gas.Coal is processed in industry to getsome useful products such as coke, coaltar and coal gas.A. CokeIt is a tough, porous and blacksubstance. It is almost pure form ofcarbon. Coke is used in the manufactureof steel and in the extraction of manymetals.B. Coal tarIt is a black, thick liquid (Fig. 5.3) withunpleasant smell. It is a mixture ofabout 200 substances. Productsobtained from coal tar are used asstarting materials for manufacturingvarious substances used in everyday lifeand in industry, like synthetic dyes,drugs, explosives, perfumes, plastics,paints, photographic materials, roofingmaterials, etc. Interestingly,naphthalene balls used to repel mothsand other insects are also obtained fromcoal tar.© NCERTnot to be republishedCOAL AND PETROLEUM59as a fuel in many industries situatednear the coal processing plants.5.2 PetroleumYou know that petrol is used as a fuel inlight automobiles such as motor cycles/scooters and cars. Heavy motor vehicleslike trucks and tractors run on diesel.Petrol and diesel are obtained from anatural resource called petroleum.Do you know how petroleum isformed?Petroleum was formed fromorganisms living in the sea. As theseorganisms died, their bodies settled atthe bottom of the sea and got coveredwith layers of sand and clay. Overmillions of years, absence of air, hightemperature and high pressuretransformed the dead organisms intopetroleum and natural gas.Refining of PetroleumPetroleum is a dark oily liquid. It hasan unpleasant odour. It is a mixture ofvarious constituents such as petroleumgas, petrol, diesel, lubricating oil,paraffin wax, etc. The process ofseparating the various constituents/Fig. 5.4 : Petroleum and natural gas depositsThe world’s first oil well was drilledin Pennsylvania, USA, in 1859. Eightyears later, in 1867, oil was stuck atMakum in Assam. In India, oil isfound in Assam, Gujarat, MumbaiHigh and in the river basins ofGodavari and Krishna.Look at Fig. 5.4. It shows the depositsof petroleum and natural gas. You seethat the layer containing petroleum oiland gas is above that of water. Why is itso? Recall that oil and gas are lighterthan water and do not mix with it.WellsGasOilWaterReservoir rockImperviousrock© NCERTnot to be republishedSCIENCE60fractions of petroleum is known asrefining. It is carried out in a petroleumrefinery (Fig. 5.5).Various constituents of petroleumand their uses are given in Table 5.1.Many useful substances are obtainedfrom petroleum and natural gas.These are termed as ‘Petrochemicals’.These are used in the manufactureof detergents, fibres (polyester, nylon,acrylic etc.), polythene and otherman-made plastics. Hydrogen gasobtained from natural gas, is used inthe production of fertilisers (urea).Due to its great commercialimportance, petroleum is also called‘black gold’.5.3 Natural GasNatural gas is a very important fossilfuel because it is easy to transportthrough pipes. Natural gas is storedunder high pressure as compressednatural gas (CNG). CNG is used forpower generation. It is now being usedas a fuel for transport vehicles becauseit is less polluting. It is a cleaner fuel.The great advantage of CNG is thatit can be used directly for burning inTable 5.1 Various constituents of petroleum and their usesS.No.Constituents of petroleum                      Uses1.Petroleum Gas in Liquid formFuel for home and industry(LPG)2.PetrolMotor fuel, aviation fuel, solvent fordry cleaning3.KeroseneFuel for stoves, lamps and for jet aircrafts4.DieselFuel for heavy motor vehicles, electricgenerators5.Lubricating oilLubrication6.Paraffin waxOintments, candles, vaseline etc.7.BitumenPaints, road surfacingFig. 5.5: A petroleum refinery© NCERTnot to be republishedCOAL AND PETROLEUM61homes and factories where it can besupplied through pipes. Such a networkof pipelines exists in Vadodara (Gujarat),some parts of Delhi and other places.Natural gas is also used as a startingmaterial for the manufacture of anumber of chemicals and fertilisers.India has vast reserves of natural gas.In our country, natural gas has beenfound in Tripura, Rajasthan,Maharashtra and in the KrishnaGodavari delta.5.4 Some Natural Resourcesare LimitedYou have studied in the beginning ofthe chapter that some natural resourcesare exhaustible like fossil fuels, forests,minerals etc.You know that coal and petroleumare fossil fuels. It required the deadorganisms millions of years to getconverted into these fuels. On the otherhand, the known reserves of these willlast atmost a few hundred years.Moreover, burning of these fuels is amajor cause of air pollution. Their useis also linked to global warming. It istherefore necessary that we use thesefuels only when absolutely necessary.This will result in better environment,smaller risk of global warming and theiravailability for a longer period of time.In India, the Petroleum ConservationResearch Association (PCRA) advisespeople how to save petrol/diesel whiledriving. Their tips are:\u0001 Drive at a constant and moderate speedas far as possible,\u0001 Switch off the engine at traffic lights orat a place where you have to wait,\u0001 Ensure correct tyre pressure, and\u0001 Ensure regular maintenance of thevehicle.Can coal, petroleumand natural gas beprepared in thelaboratory from deadorganisms?No. Theirformation is a veryslow process andconditions fortheir formationcannot be createdin the laboratory.© NCERTnot to be republishedSCIENCE62 KEYWORDSCOALCOAL GASCOAL TARCOKEFOSSIL FUELNATURAL GASPETROLEUMPETROLEUM-REFINERY WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\u0001Coal, petroleum and natural gas are fossilfuels.\u0001Fossil fuels were formed from the dead remainsof living organisms millions of years ago.\u0001Fossil fuels are exhaustible resources.\u0001Coke, coal tar and coal gas are the productsof coal.\u0001Petroleum gas, petrol, diesel, kerosene,paraffin wax, lubricating oil are obtained byrefining petroleum.\u0001Coal and petroleum resources are limited.

Written by World Economic Forum Founder Klaus Schwab and Monthly Barometer author Thierry Malleret, COVID-19: The Great Reset considers its far-reaching and dramatic implications on tomorrow’s world. The book’s main objective is to help understand what’s coming in a multitude of domains. Published in July 2020, in the midst of the crisis and when further waves of infection may still arise, it is a hybrid between a contemporary essay and an academic snapshot of a crucial moment in history. It includes theory and practical examples but is chiefly explanatory, containing many conjectures and ideas about what the post-pandemic world might, and perhaps should, look like. The book has three main chapters, offering a panoramic overview of the future landscape. The first assesses what the impact of the pandemic will be on five key macro categories: the economic, societal, geopolitical, environmental and technological factors. The second considers the effects in micro terms, on specific industries and companies. The third hypothesizes about the nature of the possible consequences at the individual level. In early July 2020, we are at a crossroads, the authors of COVID-19: The Great Reset argue. One path will take us to a better world: more inclusive, more equitable and more respectful of Mother Nature. The other will take us to a world that resembles the one we just left behind – but worse and constantly dogged by nasty surprises. We must therefore get it right. The looming challenges could be more consequential than we have until now chosen to imagine, but our capacity to reset could also be greater than we had previously dared to hope. Professor Klaus Schwab (1938, Ravensburg, Germany) is the Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum. In 1971, he published Modern Enterprise Management in Mechanical Engineering. He argues in that book that a company must serve not only shareholders but all stakeholders to achieve long-term growth and prosperity. To promote the stakeholder concept, he founded the World Economic Forum the same year. Professor Schwab holds doctorates in Economics (University of Fribourg) and in Engineering (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) and obtained a master’s degree in Public Administration (MPA) from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. In 1972, in addition to his leadership role at the Forum, he became a professor at the University of Geneva. He has since received numerous international and national honours, including 17 honorary doctorates. His latest books are The Fourth Industrial Revolution (2016), a worldwide bestseller translated into 30 languages, and Shaping the Future of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (2018). Thierry Malleret (1961, Paris, France) is the Managing Partner of the Monthly Barometer, a succinct predictive analysis provided to private investors, global CEOs and opinion- and decision-makers. His professional experience includes founding the Global Risk Network at the World Economic Forum and heading its Programme team. Malleret was educated at the Sorbonne and the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris, and at St Antony's College, Oxford. He holds master’s degrees in Economics and History, and a PhD in Economics. His career spans investment banking, think tanks, academia and government (with a three-year spell in the prime minister's office in Paris). He has written several business and academic books and has published four novels. He lives in Chamonix, France, with his wife Mary Anne. CONTENTS INTRODUCTION 1. MACRO RESET 1.1.

Nature and well-being CONCLUSION ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ENDNOTES INTRODUCTION The worldwide crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic has no parallel in modern history. We cannot be accused of hyperbole when we say it is plunging our world in its entirety and each of us individually into the most challenging times we’ve faced in generations. It is our defining moment – we will be dealing with its fallout for years, and many things will change forever. It is bringing economic disruption of monumental proportions, creating a dangerous and volatile period on multiple fronts – politically, socially, geopolitically – raising deep concerns about the environment and also extending the reach (pernicious or otherwise) of technology into our lives. No industry or business will be spared from the impact of these changes. Millions of companies risk disappearing and many industries face an uncertain future; a few will thrive. On an individual basis, for many, life as they’ve always known it is unravelling at alarming speed. But deep, existential crises also favour introspection and can harbour the potential for transformation. The fault lines of the world – most notably social divides, lack of fairness, absence of cooperation, failure of global governance and leadership – now lie exposed as never before, and people feel the time for reinvention has come. A new world will emerge, the contours of which are for us to both imagine and to draw. At the time of writing (June 2020), the pandemic continues to worsen globally. Many of us are pondering when things will return to normal. The short response is: never. Nothing will ever return to the “broken” sense of normalcy that prevailed prior to the crisis because the coronavirus pandemic marks a fundamental inflection point in our global trajectory. Some analysts call it a major bifurcation, others refer to a deep crisis of “biblical” proportions, but the essence remains the same: the world as we knew it in the early months of 2020 is no more, dissolved in the context of the pandemic. Radical changes of such consequence are coming that some pundits have referred to a “before coronavirus” (BC) and “after coronavirus” (AC) era. We will continue to be surprised by both the rapidity and unexpected nature of these changes – as they conflate with each other, they will provoke second-, third-, fourth- and more-order consequences, cascading effects and unforeseen outcomes. In so doing, they will shape a “new normal” radically different from the one we will be progressively leaving behind. Many of our beliefs and assumptions about what the world could or should look like will be shattered in the process. However, broad and radical pronouncements (like “everything will change”) and an all-or-nothing, black-and-white analysis should be deployed with great care. Of course, reality will be much more nuanced. By itself, the pandemic may not completely transform the world, but it is likely to accelerate many of the changes that were already taking place before it erupted, which will in turn set in motion other changes. The only certainty: the changes won’t be linear and sharp discontinuities will prevail. COVID19: The Great Reset is an attempt to identify and shed light on the changes ahead, and to make a modest contribution in terms of delineating what their more desirable and sustainable form might resemble. Let’s begin by putting things into perspective: human beings have been around for about 200,000 years, the oldest bacteria for billions of years and viruses for at least 300 million years. This means that, most likely, pandemics have always existed and been an integral part of human history since people started travelling around; over the past 2000 years they have been the rule, not the exception. Because of their inherently disruptive nature, epidemics throughout history have proven to be a force for lasting and often radical change: sparking riots, causing population clashes and military defeats, but also triggering innovations, redrawing national boundaries and often paving the way for revolutions. Outbreaks forced empires to change course – like the Byzantine Empire when struck by the Plague of Justinian in 541-542 – and some even to disappear altogether – when Aztec and Inca emperors died with most of their subjects from European germs. Also, authoritative measures to attempt to contain them have always been part of the policy arsenal. Thus, there is nothing new about the confinement and lockdowns imposed upon much of the world to manage COVID-19. They have been common practice for centuries. The earliest forms of confinement came with the quarantines instituted in an effort to contain the Black Death that between 1347 and 1351 killed about a third of all Europeans. Coming from the word quaranta (which means “forty” in Italian), the idea of confining people for 40 days originated without the authorities really understanding what they wanted to contain, but the measures were one of the first forms of “institutionalized public health” that helped legitimatize the “accretion of power” by the modern state. [1] The period of 40 days has no medical foundation; it was chosen for symbolic and religious reasons: both the Old and New Testaments often refer to the number 40 in the context of purification – in particular the 40 days of Lent and the 40 days of flood in Genesis. The spread of infectious diseases has a unique ability to fuel fear, anxiety and mass hysteria. In so doing, as we have seen, it also challenges our social cohesion and collective capacity to manage a crisis. Epidemics are by nature divisive and traumatizing. What we are fighting against is invisible; our family, friends and neighbours may all become sources of infection; those everyday rituals that we cherish, like meeting a friend in a public place, may become a vehicle for transmission; and the authorities that try to keep us safe by enforcing confinement measures are often perceived as agents of oppression. Throughout history, the important and recurring pattern has been to search for scapegoats and place the blame firmly on the outsider. In medieval Europe, the Jews were almost always among the victims of the most notorious pogroms provoked by the plague. One tragic example illustrates this point: in 1349, two years after the Black Death had started to rove across the continent, in Strasbourg on Valentine’s day, Jews, who’d been accused of spreading the plague by polluting the wells of the city, were asked to convert. About 1,000 refused and were burned alive. During that same year, Jewish communities in other European cities were wiped out, forcing them to massively migrate to the eastern part of Europe (in Poland and Russia), permanently altering the demography of the continent in the process. What is true for European antiSemitism also applies to the rise of the absolutist state, the gradual retreat of the church and many other historical events that can be attributed in no small measure to pandemics. The changes were so diverse and widespread that it led to “the end of an age of submission”, bringing feudalism and serfdom to an end and ushering in the era of Enlightenment. Put simply: “The Black Death may have been the unrecognized beginning of modern man.” [2] If such profound social, political and economic changes could be provoked by the plague in the medieval world, could the COVID-19 pandemic mark the onset of a similar turning point with long-lasting and dramatic consequences for our world today? Unlike certain past epidemics, COVID-19 doesn’t pose a new existential threat. It will not result in unforeseen mass famines or major military defeats and regime changes. Whole populations will neither be exterminated nor displaced as a result of the pandemic. However, this does not equate to a reassuring analysis. In reality, the pandemic is dramatically exacerbating pre-existing dangers that we’ve failed to confront adequately for too long. It will also accelerate disturbing trends that have been building up over a prolonged period of time. To begin elaborating a meaningful response, we need a conceptual framework (or a simple mental map) to help us reflect on what’s coming and to guide us in making sense of it. Insights offered by history can be particularly helpful. This is why we so often search for a reassuring “mental anchor” that can serve as a benchmark when we are forced to ask ourselves tough questions about what will change and to what extent. In doing so, we look for precedents, with questions such as: Is the pandemic like the Spanish flu of 1918 (estimated to have killed more than 50 million people worldwide in three successive waves)? Could it look like the Great Depression that started in 1929? Is there any resemblance with the psychological shock inflicted by 9/11? Are there similarities with what happened with SARS in 2003 and H1N1 in 2009 (albeit on a different scale)? Could it be like the great financial crisis of 2008, but much bigger? The correct, albeit unwelcome, answer to all of these is: no! None fits the reach and pattern of the human suffering and economic destruction caused by the current pandemic. The economic fallout in particular bears no resemblance to any crisis in modern history. As pointed out by many heads of state and government in the midst of the pandemic, we are at war, but with an enemy that is invisible, and of course metaphorically: “If what we are going through can indeed be called a war, it is certainly not a typical one. After all, today’s enemy is shared by all of humankind”. [3] That said, World War II could even so be one of the most relevant mental anchors in the effort to assess what’s coming next. World War II was the quintessential transformational war, triggering not only fundamental changes to the global order and the global economy, but also entailing radical shifts in social attitudes and beliefs that eventually paved the way for radically new policies and social contract provisions (like women joining the workforce before becoming voters). There are obviously fundamental dissimilarities between a pandemic and a war (that we will consider in some detail in the following pages), but the magnitude of their transformative power is comparable. Both have the potential to be a transformative crisis of previously unimaginable proportions. However, we must beware of superficial analogies. Even in the worst-case horrendous scenario, COVID-19 will kill far fewer people than the Great Plagues, including the Black Deaths, or World War II did. Furthermore, today’s economy bears no resemblance to those of past centuries that relied on manual labour and farmland or heavy industry. In today’s highly interconnected and interdependent world, however, the impact of the pandemic will go well beyond the (already staggering) statistics relating “simply” to death, unemployment and bankruptcies. COVID-19: The Great Reset is written and published in the midst of a crisis whose consequences will unfold over many years to come. Little wonder that we all feel somewhat bewildered – a sentiment so very understandable when an extreme shock strikes, bringing with it the disquieting certainty that its outcomes will be both unexpected and unusual. This strangeness is well captured by Albert Camus in his 1947 novel The Plague: “Yet all these changes were, in one sense, so fantastic and had been made so precipitately that it wasn’t easy to regard them as likely to have any permanence.” [4] Now that the unthinkable is upon us, what will happen next, in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic and then in the foreseeable future? It is of course much too early to tell with any reasonable accuracy what COVID-19 will entail in terms of “momentous” changes, but the objective of this book is to offer some coherent and conceptually sound guidelines about what might lie ahead, and to do so in the most comprehensive manner possible. Our aim is to help our readers grasp the multifaceted dimension of the changes that are coming. At the very least, as we will argue, the pandemic will accelerate systemic changes that were already apparent prior to the crisis: the partial retreat from globalization, the growing decoupling between the US and China, the acceleration of automation, concerns about heightened surveillance, the growing appeal of well-being policies, rising nationalism and the subsequent fear of immigration, the growing power of tech, the necessity for firms to have an even stronger online presence, among many others. But it could go beyond a mere acceleration by altering things that previously seemed unchangeable. It might thus provoke changes that would have seemed inconceivable before the pandemic struck, such as new forms of monetary policy like helicopter money (already a given), the reconsideration/recalibration of some of our social priorities and an augmented search for the common good as a policy objective, the notion of fairness acquiring political potency, radical welfare and taxation measures, and drastic geopolitical realignments. The broader point is this: the possibilities for change and the resulting new order are now unlimited and only bound by our imagination, for better or for worse. Societies could be poised to become either more egalitarian or more authoritarian, or geared towards more solidarity or more individualism, favouring the interests of the few or the many; economies, when they recover, could take the path of more inclusivity and be more attuned to the needs of our global commons, or they could return to functioning as they did before. You get the point: we should take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to reimagine our world, in a bid to make it a better and more resilient one as it emerges on the other side of this crisis. We are conscious that attempting to cover the scope and breadth of all the issues addressed in this book is an enormous task that may not even be possible. The subject and all the uncertainties attached to it are gargantuan and could have filled the pages of a publication five times the size of this one. But our objective was to write a relatively concise and simple book to help the reader understand what’s coming in a multitude of domains. To interrupt the flow of the text as little as possible, the reference information appears at the end of the book and direct attributions have been minimized. Published in the midst of the crisis and when further waves of infection are expected, it will continuously evolve to consider the changing nature of the subject matter. Future editions will be updated in view of new findings, the latest research, revised policy measures and ongoing feedback from readers. This volume is a hybrid between a light academic book and an essay. It includes theory and practical examples but is chiefly explanatory, containing many conjectures and ideas about what the post-pandemic world might, and perhaps should, look like. It offers neither simple generalizations nor recommendations for a world moving to a new normal, but we trust it will be useful. This book is structured around three main chapters, offering a panoramic overview of the future landscape. The first assesses what the impact of the pandemic will be on five key macro categories: the economic, societal, geopolitical, environmental and technological factors. The second considers the effects in micro terms, on specific industries and companies. The third hypothesizes about the nature of the possible consequences at the individual level. 1. MACRO RESET The first leg of our journey progresses across five macro categories that offer a comprehensive analytical framework to understand what’s going on in today’s world and how this might evolve. For ease of reading, we travel thematically through each separately. In reality, they are interdependent, which is where we begin: our brains make us think in linear terms, but the world that surrounds us is non-linear, that is to say: complex, adaptive, fast-paced and ambiguous. 1.1. Conceptual framework – Three defining characteristics of today’s world The macro reset will occur in the context of the three prevailing secular forces that shape our world today: interdependence, velocity and complexity. This trio exerts its force, to a lesser or greater degree, on us all, whoever or wherever we may be. 1.1.1. Interdependence If just one word had to distil the essence of the 21st century, it would have to be “interdependence”. A by-product of globalization and technological progress, it can essentially be defined as the dynamic of reciprocal dependence among the elements that compose a system. The fact that globalization and technological progress have advanced so much over the past few decades has prompted some pundits to declare that the world is now “hyperconnected” – a variant of interdependence on steroids! What does this interdependence mean in practice? Simply that the world is “concatenated”: linked together. In the early 2010s, Kishore Mahbubani, an academic and former diplomat from Singapore, captured this reality with a boat metaphor: “The 7 billion people who inhabit planet earth no longer live in more than one hundred separate boats [countries]. Instead, they all live in 193 separate cabins on the same boat.” In his own words, this is one of the greatest transformations ever. In 2020, he pursued this metaphor further in the context of the pandemic by writing: “If we 7.5 billion people are now stuck together on a virus-infected cruise ship, does it make sense to clean and scrub only our personal cabins while ignoring the corridors and air wells outside, through which the virus travels? The answer is clearly: no. Yet, this is what we have been doing. … Since we are now in the same boat, humanity has to take care of the global boat as a whole”. [5] An interdependent world is a world of deep systemic connectivity, in which all risks affect each other through a web of complex interactions. In such conditions, the assertion that an economic risk will be confined to the economic sphere or that an environmental risk won’t have repercussions on risks of a different nature (economic, geopolitical and so on) is no longer tenable. We can all think of economic risks turning into political ones (like a sharp rise in unemployment leading to pockets of social unrest), or of technological risks mutating into societal ones (such as the issue of tracing the pandemic on mobile phones provoking a societal backlash). When considered in isolation, individual risks – whether economic, geopolitical, societal or environmental in character – give the false impression that they can be contained or mitigated; in real life, systemic connectivity shows this to be an artificial construct. In an interdependent world, risks amplify each other and, in so doing, have cascading effects. That is why isolation or containment cannot rhyme with interdependence and interconnectedness. The chart below, extracted from the World Economic ForumGlobal Risks Report 2020, [6] makes this plain. It illustrates the interconnected nature of the risks we collectively face; each individual risk always conflates with those from its own macro category but also with the individual risks from the other macro categories (economic risks appear in blue, geopolitical in orange, societal in red, environmental in green and technological in purple). In this manner, each individual risk harbours the potential to create ricochet effects by provoking other risks. As the chart makes clear, an “infectious diseases” risk is bound to have a direct effect on “global governance failure”, “social instability”, “unemployment”, “fiscal crises” and “involuntary migration” (to name just a few). Each of these in turn will influence other individual risks, meaning that the individual risk from which the chain of effects started (in this particular case “infectious diseases”) ends up amplifying many other risks not only in its own macro category (societal risks), but also in the other four macro categories. This displays the phenomenon of contagion by systemic connectivity. In the following sub-chapters, we explore what the pandemic risk might entail from an economic, societal, geopolitical, environmental and technological perspective. Figure 1 Source: World Economic Forum, The Global Risks Report 2020, Figure IV: The Global Risks Interconnections Map 2020, World Economic Forum Global Risks Perception Survey 2019-2020 Interdependence has an important conceptual effect: it invalidates “silo thinking”. Since conflation and systemic connectivity are what ultimately matter, addressing a problem or assessing an issue or a risk in isolation from the others is senseless and futile. In the past, this “silo thinking” partly explains why so many economists failed to predict the credit crisis (in 2008) and why so few political scientists saw the Arab Spring coming (in 2011). Today, the problem is the same with the pandemic. Epidemiologists, public-health specialists, economists, social scientists and all the other scientists and specialists who are in the business of helping decision-makers understand what lies ahead find it difficult (and sometimes impossible) to cross the boundaries of their own discipline. That is why addressing complex trade-offs, such as containing the progression of the pandemic versus reopening the economy, is so fiendishly difficult. Understandably, most experts end up being segregated into increasingly narrow fields. Therefore, they lack the enlarged view necessary to connect the many different dots that provide the more complete picture the decision-makers desperately need. 1.1.2. Velocity The above firmly points the finger at technological progress and globalization as the primary “culprits” responsible for greater interdependence. In addition, they have created such a culture of immediacy that it’s not an exaggeration to claim that, in today’s world, everything moves much faster than before. If just one thing were to be singled out to explain this astonishing increase in velocity, it would undoubtedly be the internet. More than half (52%) of the world’s population is now online, compared to less than 8% 20 years ago; in 2019, more than 1.5 billion smartphones – a symbol and vector of velocity that allows us to be reached anywhere and at any time – were sold around the world. The internet of things (IoT) now connects 22 billion devices in real time, ranging from cars to hospital beds, electric grids and water station pumps, to kitchen ovens and agricultural irrigation systems. This number is expected to reach 50 billion or more in 2030. Other explanations for the rise in velocity point to the “scarcity” element: as societies get richer, time becomes more valuable and is therefore perceived as evermore scarce. This may explain studies showing that people in wealthy cities always walk faster than in poor cities – they have no time to lose! No matter what the causal explanation is, the endgame of all this is clear: as consumers and producers, spouses and parents, leaders and followers, we are all being subjected to constant, albeit discontinuous, rapid change. We can see velocity everywhere; whether it’s a crisis, social discontent, technological developments and adoption, geopolitical upheaval, the financial markets and, of course, the manifestation of infectious diseases – everything now runs on fast-forward. As a result, we operate in a real-time society, with the nagging feeling that the pace of life is ever increasing. This new culture of immediacy, obsessed with speed, is apparent in all aspects of our lives, from “just-in-time” supply chains to “high-frequency” trading, from speed dating to fast food. It is so pervasive that some pundits call this new phenomenon the “dictatorship of urgency”. It can indeed take extreme forms. Research performed by scientists at Microsoft shows, for example, that being slower by no more than 250 milliseconds (a quarter of a second) is enough for a website to lose hits to its “faster” competitors! The all-embracing result is that the shelf life of a policy, a product or an idea, and the life cycle of a decision-maker or a project, are contracting sharply and often unpredictably. Nothing illustrated this more vividly than the breakneck speed with which COVID-19 progressed in March 2020. In less than a month, from the maelstrom provoked by the staggering speed at which the pandemic engulfed most of the world, a whole new era seemed to emerge. The beginning of the outbreak was thought to have taken place in China sometime earlier, but the exponential global progression of the pandemic took many decision-makers and a majority of the public by surprise because we generally find it cognitively hard to grasp the significance of exponential growth. Consider the following in terms of “days for doubling”: if a pandemic grows at 30% a day (as COVID-19 did around mid-March for some of the worst affected countries), registered cases (or deaths) will double in a little more than two days. If it grows at 20%, it will take between four and five days; and if it grows at 10%, it will take just more than a week. Expressed differently: at the global level, it took COVID-19 three months to reach 100,000 cases, 12 days to double to 200,000 cases, four days to reach 300,000 cases, and then 400,000 and 500,000 cases were reached in two days each. These numbers make our heads spin – extreme velocity in action! Exponential growth is so baffling to our cognitive functions that we often deal with it by developing exponential “myopia”, [7] thinking of it as nothing more than “very fast”. In a famous experiment conducted in 1975, two psychologists found that when we have to predict an exponential process, we often underestimate it by factor of 10. [8] Understanding this growth dynamic and the power of exponentials clarifies why velocity is such an issue and why the speed of intervention to curb the rate of growth is so crucial. Ernest Hemingway understood this. In his novel The Sun Also Rises, two characters have the following conversation: “How did you go bankrupt?\" Bill asked. “Two ways,” Mike said. “Gradually, then suddenly.” The same tends to happen for big systemic shifts and disruption in general: things tend to change gradually at first and then all at once. Expect the same for the macro reset. Not only does velocity take extreme forms, but it can also engender perverse effects. “Impatience”, for example, is one, the effects of which can be seen similarly in the behaviour of participants in the financial markets (with new research suggesting that momentum trading, based on velocity, leads stock prices to deviate persistently from their fundamental value or “correct” price) and in that of voters in an election. The latter will have a critical relevance in the post-pandemic era. Governments, by necessity, take a while to make decisions and implement them: they are obliged to consider many different constituency groups and competing interests, balance domestic concerns with external considerations and secure legislative approval, before putting into motion the bureaucratic machinery to action all these decisions. By contrast, voters expect almost immediate policy results and improvements, which, when they don’t arrive fast enough, lead to almost instantaneous disappointment. This problem of asynchronicity between two different groups (policy-makers and the public) whose time horizon differs so markedly will be acute and very difficult to manage in the context of the pandemic. The velocity of the shock and (the depth) of the pain it has inflicted will not and cannot be matched with equal velocity on the policy side. Velocity also led many observers to establish a false equivalence by comparing seasonal flu with COVID-19. This comparison, made again and again in the early months of the pandemic, was misleading and conceptually erroneous. Let’s take the example of the US to hammer out the point and better grasp the role played by velocity in all of this. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), between 39 and 56 million Americans contracted the flu during the 2019-2020 winter season, with between 24,000 and 62,000 deaths. [9] By contrast, and according to Johns Hopkins University, on 24 June 2020, more than 2.3 million were diagnosed with COVID-19 and almost 121,000 people had died. [10] But the comparison stops there; it is meaningless for two reasons: 1) the flu numbers correspond to the estimated total flu burden while the COVID-19 figures are confirmed cases; and 2) the seasonal flu cascades in “gentle” waves over a period of (up to six) months in an even pattern while the COVID-19 virus spreads like a tsunami in a hotspot pattern (in a handful of cities and regions where it concentrates) and, in doing so, can overwhelm and jam healthcare capacities, monopolizing hospitals to the detriment of non-COVID-19 patients. The second reason – the velocity with which the COVID-19 pandemic surges and the suddenness with which clusters emerge – makes all the difference and renders the comparison with the flu irrelevant. Velocity lies at the root of the first and second reasons: in a vast majority of countries, the speed with which the epidemic progressed made it impossible to have sufficient testing capabilities, and it then overwhelmed many national health systems equipped to deal with a predictable, recurrent and rather slow seasonal flu but not with a “superfast” pandemic. Another important and far-reaching consequence of velocity is that decision-makers have more information and more analysis than ever before, but less time to decide. For politicians and business leaders, the need to gain a strategic perspective collides ever-more frequently with the day-to-day pressures of immediate decisions, particularly obvious in the context of the pandemic, and reinforced by complexity, as we see in the next section. 1.1.3. Complexity In its simplest possible form, complexity can be defined as what we don’t understand or find difficult to understand. As for a complex system, the psychologist Herbert Simon defined it as “one made up of a large number of parts that interact in a nonsimple way”. [11] Complex systems are often characterized by an absence of visible causal links between their elements, which makes them virtually impossible to predict. Deep in ourselves, we sense that the more complex a system is, the greater the likelihood that something might go wrong and that an accident or an aberration might occur and propagate. Complexity can roughly be measured by three factors: “1) the amount of information content or the number of components in a system; 2) the interconnectedness – defined as the dynamic of reciprocal responsiveness – between these pieces of information or components; and 3) the effect of non-linearity (non-linear elements are often called ‘tipping points’). Non-linearity is a key feature of complexity because it means that a change in just one component of a system can lead to a surprising and disproportionate effect elsewhere.” [12] It is for this reason that pandemic models so often yield wide ranges of outcomes: a difference of assumption regarding just one component of the model can dramatically affect the end result. When one hears about “black swans”, “known unknowns” or “butterfly effects”, non-linearity is at work; it thus comes as no surprise that we often associate world complexity with “surprises”, “turbulence” and “uncertainty”. For example, in 2008, how many “experts” anticipated that mortgage-backed securities originating in the United States would cripple banks around the world and ultimately bring the global financial system to the verge of collapse? And in the early weeks of 2020, how many decision-makers foresaw the extent to which a possible pandemic would wreak havoc on some of the most sophisticated health systems in the world and would inflict such major damage to the global economy? A pandemic is a complex adaptive system comprising many different components or pieces of information (as diverse as biology or psychology), whose behaviour is influenced by such variables as the role of companies, economic policies, government intervention, healthcare politics or national governance. For this reason, it can and should be viewed as a “living network” that adapts to changing conditions – not something set in stone, but a system of interactions that is both complex and adaptive. It is complex because it represents a “cat’s cradle” of interdependence and interconnections from which it stems, and adaptive in the sense that its “behaviour” is driven by interactions between nodes (the organizations, the people – us!) that can become confused and “unruly” in times of stress (Will we adjust to the norms of confinement? Will a majority of us – or not – abide by the rules? etc.). The management (the containment, in this particular case) of a complex adaptive system requires continuous real-time but ever-changing collaboration between a vast array of disciplines, and between different fields within these disciplines. Just to provide a broad and oversimplified example, the containment of the coronavirus pandemic will necessitate a global surveillance network capable of identifying new outbreaks as soon as they arise, laboratories in multiple locations around the world that can rapidly analyse new viral strains and develop effective treatments, large IT infrastructures so that communities can prepare and react effectively, appropriate and coordinated policy mechanisms to efficiently implement the decisions once they are made, and so on. The important point is this: each separate activity by itself is necessary to address the pandemic but is insufficient if not considered in conjunction with the others. It follows that this complex adaptive system is greater than the sum of its parts. Its effectiveness depends on how well it works as a whole, and it is only as strong as its weakest link. Many pundits have mischaracterized the COVID-19 pandemic as a black-swan event simply because it exhibits all the characteristics of a complex adaptive system. But in reality it is a white-swan event, something explicitly presented as such by Nassim Taleb in The Black Swan published in 2007: something that would eventually take place with a great deal of certainty. [13] Indeed! For years, international organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO), institutions like the World Economic Forum and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI – launched at the Annual Meeting 2017 in Davos), and individuals like Bill Gates have been warning us about the next pandemic risk, even specifying that it: 1) would emerge in a highly populated place where economic development forces people and wildlife together; 2) would spread quickly and silently by exploiting networks of human travel and trade; and 3) would reach multiple countries by thwarting containment. As we will see in the following chapters, properly characterizing the pandemic and understanding its characteristics are vital because they were what underpinned the differences in terms of preparedness. Many Asian countries reacted quickly because they were prepared logistically and organizationally (due to SARS) and thus were able to lessen the impact of the pandemic. By contrast, many Western countries were unprepared and were ravaged by the pandemic – it is no coincidence that they are the ones in which the false notion of a blackswan event circulated the most. However, we can confidently assert that the pandemic (a high probability, high consequences white-swan event) will provoke many black-swan events through second-, third-, fourth- and more-order effects. It is hard, if not impossible, to foresee what might happen at the end of the chain when multiple-order effects and their ensuing cascades of consequences have occurred after unemployment spikes, companies go bust and some countries are teetering on the verge of collapse. None of these are unpredictable per se, but it is their propensity to create perfect storms when they conflate with other risks that will take us by surprise. To sum up, the pandemic is not a black-swan event, but some of its consequences will be. The fundamental point here is this: complexity creates limits to our knowledge and understanding of things; it might thus be that today’s increasing complexity literally overwhelms the capabilities of politicians in particular – and decision-makers in general – to make well informed decisions. A theoretical physicist turned head of state (President Armen Sarkissian of Armenia) made this point when he coined the expression “quantum politics”, outlining how the classical world of post-Newtonian physics – linear, predictable and to some extent even deterministic – had given way to the quantum world: highly interconnected and uncertain, incredibly complex and also changing depending on the position of the observer. This expression recalls quantum physics, which explains how everything works and is “the best description we have of the nature of the particles that make up matter and the forces with which they interact.” [14] The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare this quantum world. 1.2. Economic reset 1.2.1. The economics of COVID-19 Our contemporary economy differs radically from that of previous centuries. Compared to the past, it is infinitely more interconnected, intricate and complex. It is characterized by a world population that has grown exponentially, by airplanes that connect any point anywhere to another somewhere else in just a few hours, resulting in more than a billion of us crossing a border each year, by humans encroaching on nature and the habitats of wildlife, by ubiquitous, sprawling megacities that are home to millions of people living cheek by jowl (often without adequate sanitation and medical care). Measured against the landscape of just a few decades ago, let alone centuries ago, today’s economy is simply unrecognizable. Notwithstanding, some of the economic lessons to be gleaned from historical pandemics are still valid today to help grasp what lies ahead. The global economic catastrophe that we are now confronting is the deepest recorded since 1945; in terms of its sheer speed, it is unparalleled in history. Although it does not rival the calamities and the absolute economic desperation that societies endured in the past, there are some telling characteristics that are hauntingly similar. When in 1665, over the space of 18 months, the last bubonic plague had eradicated a quarter of London’s population, Daniel Defoe wrote inA Journal of the Plague Year [15] (published in 1722): “All trades being stopped, employment ceased: the labour, and by that the bread, of the poor were cut off; and at first indeed the cries of the poor were most lamentable to hear … thousands of them having stayed in London till nothing but desperation sent them away, death overtook them on the road, and they served for no better than the messengers of death.” Defoe’s book is full of anecdotes that resonate with today’s situation, telling us how the rich were escaping to the country, “taking death with them”, and observing how the poor were much more exposed to the outbreak, or describing how “quacks and mountebanks” sold false cures. [16] What the history of previous epidemics shows again and again is how pandemics exploit trade routes and the clash that exists between the interests of public health and those of economics (something that constitutes an economic “aberration” as we will see in just a few pages). As the historian Simon Schama describes: In the midst of calamity, economics was always at loggerheads with the interests of public health. Even though, until there was an understanding of germ-borne diseases, the plague was mostly attributed to ‘foul air’ and noxious vapours said to arise from stagnant or polluted marshes, there was nonetheless a sense that the very commercial arteries that had generated prosperity were now transformed into vectors of poison. But when quarantines were proposed or imposed (…), those who stood to lose most, merchants and in some places artisans and workers, from the stoppage of markets, fairs and trade, put up stiff resistance. Must the economy die so that it could be resurrected in robust good health? Yes, said the guardians of public health, who became part of urban life in Europe from the 15th century onwards. [17] History shows that epidemics have been the great resetter of countries’ economy and social fabric. Why should it be different with COVID-19? A seminal paper on the long-term economic consequences of major pandemics throughout history shows that significant macroeconomic after-effects can persist for as long as 40 years, substantially depressing real rates of return. [18] This is in contrast to wars that have the opposite effect: they destroy capital while pandemics do not – wars trigger higher real interest rates, implying greater economic activity, while pandemics trigger lower real rates, implying sluggish economic activity. In addition, consumers tend to react to the shock by increasing their savings, either because of new precautionary concerns, or simply to replace the wealth lost during the epidemic. On the labour side, there will be gains at the expense of capital since real wages tend to rise after pandemics. As far back as the Black Death that ravaged Europe from 1347 to 1351 (and that suppressed 40% of Europe’s population in just a few years), workers discovered for the first time in their life that the power to change things was in their hands. Barely a year after the epidemic had subsided, textile workers in Saint-Omer (a small city in northern France) demanded and received successive wage rises. Two years later, many workers’ guilds negotiated shorter hours and higher pay, sometimes as much as a third more than their pre-plague level. Similar but less extreme examples of other pandemics point to the same conclusion: labour gains in power to the detriment of capital. Nowadays, this phenomenon may be exacerbated by the ageing of much of the population around the world (Africa and India are notable exceptions), but such a scenario today risks being radically altered by the rise of automation, an issue to which we will return in section 1.6. Unlike previous pandemics, it is far from certain that the COVID-19 crisis will tip the balance in favour of labour and against capital. For political and social reasons, it could, but technology changes the mix. 1.2.1.1. Uncertainty The high degree of ongoing uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 makes it incredibly difficult to precisely assess the risk it poses. As with all new risks that are agents of fear, this creates a lot of social anxiety that impacts economic behaviour. An overwhelming consensus has emerged within the global scientific community that Jin Qi (one of China’s leading scientists) had it right when he said in April 2020: “This is very likely to be an epidemic that co-exists with humans for a long time, becomes seasonal and is sustained within human bodies.” [19] Ever since the pandemic started, we have been bombarded daily with a relentless stream of data but, in June 2020, roughly half a year after the beginning of the outbreak, our knowledge is still very patchy and as a result we still don’t really know just how dangerous COVID-19 is. Despite the deluge of scientific papers published on the coronavirus, its infection fatality rate (i.e. the number of COVID-19 cases, measured or not, that result in death) remains a matter of debate (around 0.4%-0.5% and possibly up to 1%). The ratio of undetected to confirmed cases, the rate of transmissions from asymptomatic individuals, the seasonality effect, the length of the incubation period, the national infection rates – progress in terms of understanding each of these is being made, but they and many other elements remain “known unknowns” to a large extent. For policy-makers and public officials, this prevailing level of uncertainty makes it very difficult to devise the right public-health strategy and the concomitant economic strategy. This should not come as a surprise. Anne Rimoin, a professor of epidemiology at UCLA, confesses: “This is a novel virus, new to humanity, and nobody knows what will happen.” [20] Such circumstances require a good dose of humility because, in the words of Peter Piot (one of the world’s leading virologists): “The more we learn about the coronavirus, the more questions arise.” [21] COVID-19 is a master of disguise that manifests itself with protean symptoms that are confounding the medical community. It is first and foremost a respiratory disease but, for a small but sizeable number of patients, symptoms range from cardiac inflammation and digestive problems to kidney infection, blood clots and meningitis. In addition, many people who recover are left with chronic kidney and heart problems, as well as lasting neurological effects. In the face of uncertainty, it makes sense to resort to scenarios to get a better sense of what lies ahead. With the pandemic, it is well understood that a wide range of potential outcomes is possible, subject to unforeseen events and random occurrences, but three plausible scenarios stand out. Each may help to delineate the contours of what the next two years could be like. These three plausible scenarios [22] are all based on the core assumption that the pandemic could go on affecting us until 2022; thus they can help us to reflect upon what lies ahead. In the first scenario, the initial wave that began in March 2020 is followed by a series of smaller waves that occur through mid-2020 and then over a one- to two-year period, gradually diminishing in 2021, like “peaks and valleys”. The occurrence and amplitude of these peaks and valleys vary geographically and depend on the specific mitigation measures that are implemented. In the second scenario, the first wave is followed by a larger wave that takes place in the third or fourth quarter of 2020, and one or several smaller subsequent waves in 2021 (like during the 1918-1919 Spanish flu pandemic). This scenario requires the reimplementation of mitigation measures around the fourth quarter of 2020 to contain the spread of infection and to prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. In the third scenario, not seen with past influenza pandemics but possible for COVID-19, a “slow burn” of ongoing transmission and case occurrence follow the first wave of 2020, but without a clear wave pattern, just with smaller ups and downs. Like for the other scenarios, this pattern varies geographically and is to a certain extent determined by the nature of the earlier mitigation measures put into place in each particular country or region. Cases of infection and deaths continue to occur, but do not require the reinstitution of mitigation measures. A large number of scientists seem to agree with the framework offered by these three scenarios. Whichever of the three the pandemic follows, they all mean, as the authors explicitly state, that policymakers must be prepared to deal with “at least another 18 to 24 months of significant COVID-19 activity, with hotspots popping up periodically in diverse geographic areas”. As we will argue next, a full-fledged economic recovery cannot take place until the virus is defeated or behind us.\n","Contents of light_notes (1).txt:\n","LIGHT\rT\rhe world is largely known through\rthe senses. The sense of sight\ris one of the most important\rsenses. Through it we see mountains,\rrivers, trees, plants, chairs, people and\rso many other things around us. We also\rsee clouds, rainbows and birds flying\rin the sky. At night we see the moon\rand the stars. You are able to see the\rwords and sentences printed on this\rpage. How is seeing made possible?\r16.1 What makes Things\rVisible\rHave you ever thought how we see\rvarious objects? You may say that eyes\rsee the objects. But, can you see an\robject in the dark? It means that eyes\ralone cannot see any object. It is only\rwhen light from an object enters our\reyes that we see the object. The light\rmay have been emitted by the object, or\rmay have been reflected by it.\rYou learnt in Class VII that a polished\ror a shiny surface can act as a mirror. A\rmirror changes the direction of light\rthat falls on it. Can you tell in which\rdirection the light falling on a surface\rwill be reflected? Let us find out.\r16.2 Laws of Reflection\rActivity 16.1\rFix a white sheet of paper on a\rdrawing board or a table. Take a\rcomb and close all its openings\rexcept one in the middle. You can\ruse a strip of black paper for\rthis purpose. Hold the comb\rperpendicular to the sheet of paper.\rThrow light from a torch through\rthe opening of the comb from one\rside (Fig. 16.1). With slight\radjustment of the torch and the\rcomb you will see a ray of light along\rthe paper on the other side of the\rcomb. Keep the comb and the torch\rsteady. Place a strip of plane mirror\rin the path of the light ray (Fig.\r16.1). What do you observe?\rAfter striking the mirror, the ray of\rlight is reflected in another direction.\rThe light ray, which strikes any surface,\ris called the incident ray. The ray that\rcomes back from the surface after\rreflection is known as the reflected ray.\rFig. 16.1 : Arrangement for showing reflection\r2015-16 (11-11-2014)\r200 SCIENCE\rA ray of light is an idealisation. In\rreality, we have a narrow beam of\rlight which is made up of several\rrays. For simplicity, we use the term\rray for a narrow beam of light.\rDraw lines showing the position of\rthe plane mirror, the incident ray and\rthe reflected ray on the paper with the\rhelp of your friends. Remove the mirror\rand the comb. Draw a line making an\rangle of 90º to the line representing the\rmirror at the point where the incident\rray strikes the mirror. This line is known\ras the normal to the reflecting surface\rat that point (Fig. 16.2). The angle\rTable 16.1 : Angles of Incidence\rand Reflection\rS. Angle of Angle of\rNo. Incidence (∠i) Reflection (∠r)\r1.\r2.\r3.\r4.\r5.\rDo you see any relation between the\rangle of incidence and the angle of\rreflection. Are they approximately equal?\rIf the experiment is carried out carefully,\rit is seen that the angle of incidence is\ralways equal to the angle of reflection.\rThis is known as the law of reflection.\rLet us perform another activity on\rreflection.\rWhat would happen if I\rthrew the light on the\rmirror along the normal.\rActivity 16.2\rPerform Activity 16.1 again. This\rtime use a sheet of stiff paper or a\rchart paper. Let the sheet project a\rlittle beyond the edge of the Table\r(Fig. 16.4). Cut the projecting\rportion of the sheet in the middle.\rLook at the reflected ray. Make sure\rthat the reflected ray extends to the\rprojected portion of the paper. Bend\rthat part of the projected portion on\rwhich the reflected ray falls. Can\ryou still see the reflected ray? Bring\rthe paper back to the original\rFig. 16.2 : Drawing the normal\rFig. 16.3 : Angle of incidence and angle of\rreflection\rReflected\rray\rNormal\rIncident\rray\rbetween the normal and incident ray is\rcalled the angle of incidence (∠i). The\rangle between the normal and the\rreflected ray is known as the angle of\rreflection (∠r) (Fig. 16.3). Measure the\rangle of incidence and the angle of\rreflection. Repeat the activity several\rtimes by changing the angle of\rincidence. Enter the data in Table 16.1.\r2015-16 (11-11-2014)\rLIGHT 201\rposition. Can you see the reflected\rray again? What do you infer?\rwith the sun as the source of light instead\rof a torch. You, too, can use the sun as\rthe source of light.\rThese activities can also be performed\rby making use of the Ray Streak\rApparatus (available in the kit\rprepared by NCERT).\rBoojho remembered that in Class VII,\rhe had studied some features of the\rimage of an object formed by a plane\rmirror. Paheli asked him to recall those\rfeatures:\r(i) Was the image erect or upside\rdown?\r(ii) Was it of the same size as the\robject?\r(iii) Did the image appear at the same\rdistance behind the mirror as the\robject was in front of it?\r(iv) Could it be obtained on a screen?\rLet us understand a little more about\rthe formation of an image by a plane\rmirror in the following way:\rActivity 16.3\rA source of light O is placed in front\rof a plane mirror PQ. Two rays OA\rand OC are incident on it (Fig. 16.5).\rCan you find out the direction of\rthe reflected rays?\rDraw normals to the surface of the\rmirror PQ, at the points A and C.\rThen draw the reflected rays at the\rpoints A and C. How would you\rdraw these rays? Call the reflected\rrays AB and CD, respectively.\rExtend them further. Do they meet?\rExtend them backwards. Do they\rmeet now? If they meet, mark this\rpoint as I. For a viewer’s eye at E\r(Fig. 16.5), do the reflected rays\r(b)\rFig. 16.4 (a), (b) : Incident ray, reflected ray\rand the normal at the point\rof incidence lie in the same\rplane\rWhen the whole sheet of paper is\rspread on the table, it represents one\rplane. The incident ray, the normal at\rthe point of incidence and the reflected\rray are all in this plane. When you bend\rthe paper you create a plane different\rfrom the plane in which the incident\rray and the normal lie. Then you do not\rsee the reflected ray. What does it\rindicate? It indicates that the incident\rray, the normal at the point of\rincidence and the reflected ray all lie\rin the same plane. This is another law\rof reflection.\rPaheli and Boojho performed the\rabove activities outside the classroom\r(a)\r2015-16 (11-11-2014)\r202 SCIENCE\rappear to come from the point I.\rSince the reflected rays do not\ractually meet at I, but only appear\rto do so, we say that a virtual image\rof the point O is formed at I. As you\rhave learnt already in Class VII,\rsuch an image cannot be obtained\ron a screen.\rYou may recall that in an image\rformed by a mirror the left of the object\rappears on the right and the right\rappears on the left. This is known as\rlateral inversion.\r16.3 Regular and Diffused\rReflection\rActivity 16.4\rImagine that parallel rays are\rincident on an irregular surface as\rshown in Fig. 16.6. Remember that\rthe laws of reflection are valid at\reach point of the surface. Use these\rlaws to construct reflected rays at\rvarious points. Are they parallel to\rone another? You will find that\rthese rays are reflected in different\rdirections. (Fig. 16.7)\rWhen all the parallel rays reflected\rfrom a plane surface are not parallel,\rthe reflection is known as diffused or\rirregular reflection. Remember that the\rdiffused reflection is not due to the\rfailure of the laws of reflection. It is\rcaused by the irregularities in the\rreflecting surface, like that of a\rcardboard.\rOn the other hand, reflection from\ra smooth surface like that of a mirror\ris called regular reflection (Fig. 16.8).\rImages are formed by regular\rreflection.\rFig. 16.5 : Image formation in a plane mirror\rFig. 16.6 : Parallel rays incident on\ran irregular surface\rFig. 16.7 : Rays reflected from irregular\rsurface\rFig. 16.8 : Regular reflection\r2015-16 (11-11-2014)\rLIGHT 203\rLet us find out.\r16.4 Reflected Light Can be\rReflected Again\rRecall the last time you visited a hair\rdresser. She/he makes you sit in front of\ra mirror. After your hair cut is complete,\rshe/he holds a mirror behind you to show\ryou how the hair has been cut\r(Fig. 16.9). Do you know how you could\rsee the hair at the back of your head?\rPaheli recalls having constructed a\rperiscope as an Extended Activity in\rClass VI. The periscope makes use of\rtwo plane mirrors. Can you explain\rhow reflection from the two mirrors\renables you to see objects which are\rnot visible directly? Periscopes are\rused in submarines, tanks and also\rby soldiers in bunkers to see things\routside.\r16.5 Multiple Images\rYou are aware that a plane mirror forms\ronly a single image of an object. What\rhappens if two plane mirrors are used\rin combination? Let us see.\rDo We See all Objects due to Reflected Light?\rNearly everything you see around is seen due to reflected light. Moon, for example,\rreceives light from the sun and reflects it. That’s how we see the moon. The objects\rwhich shine in the light of other objects are called illuminated objects. Can you\rname some other such objects?\rThere are other objects, which give their own light, such as the sun, fire, flame\rof a candle and an electric lamp. Their light falls on our eyes. That is how we see\rthem. The objects which emit their own light are known as luminous objects.\rFig. 16.9 : Mirror at the hair dresser shop\rI have a question. Can the\rreflected rays be further reflected\rif incident on another mirror?\r2015-16 (11-11-2014)\r204 SCIENCE\rActivity 16.5\rTake two plane mirrors. Set them\rat right angles to each other with\rtheir edges touching (Fig. 16.10). To\rhinge them you can use adhesive\rtape. Place a coin in between the\rmirrors. How many images of the\rcoin do you see (Fig. 16.10)?\rNow hinge the mirrors using the\radhesive tape at different angles, say\r45º, 60º, 120º, 180º, etc. Place some\robject (say a candle) in between\rthem. Note down the number of\rimages of the object in each case.\rFinally, set the two mirrors\rparallel to each other. Find out how\rmany images of a candle placed\rbetween them are formed (Fig.\r16.11).\rFig. 16.10 : Images in plane mirror at right\rangle to each other\rFig. 16.11 : Image in plane mirror parallel\rto each other\rmirrors\r(a)\r(b) (c)\rCan you now explain how you can\rsee the back of your head at the hair\rdresser’s shop?\rThis idea of number of images formed\rby mirrors placed at an angle to one\ranother is used in a kaleidoscope to\rmake numerous beautiful patterns. You\rcan also make a kaleidoscope yourself.\rKaleidoscope\rActivity 16.6\rTo make a kaleidoscope, get three\rrectangular mirror strips each\rabout 15 cm long and 4 cm wide.\rJoin them together to form a prism\ras shown in Fig. 16.12(a). Fix them\rin a circular cardboard tube or tube\rof a thick chart paper. Make sure\rthat the tube is slightly longer than\rthe mirror strips. Close one end of\rthe tube by a cardboard disc\rhaving a hole in the centre,\rthrough which you can see [Fig.\r16.12(b)]. To make the disc durable,\rpaste a piece of transparent plastic\rsheet under the cardboard disc. At\rFig. 16.12 : Making a kaleidoscope\r2015-16 (11-11-2014)\rLIGHT 205\rthe other end, touching the\rmirrors, fix a circular plane glass\rplate [Fig. 16.12(c)]. Place on this\rglass plate several small pieces of\rcoloured glass (broken pieces of\rcoloured bangles). Close this end\rof the tube by a ground glass plate.\rAllow enough space for the colour\rpieces to move around.\rYour kaleidoscope is ready. When\ryou peep through the hole, you will be\rable to see a variety of patterns in the\rtube. An interesting feature of a\rkaleidoscope is that you will never see\rthe same pattern again. Designers of\rwallpapers and fabrics and artists use\rkaleidoscopes to get ideas for new\rpatterns. To make your toy attractive,\ryou can wrap the kaleidoscope in a\rcoloured paper.\r16.6 Sunlight — White or\rColoured\rIn Class VII, you learnt that the sunlight\ris referred to as white light. You also\rlearnt that it consists of seven colours.\rHere is another activity (Activity 16.7)\rshowing that sunlight consists of several\rcolours.\r16.7 What is inside Our Eyes?\rWe see things only when light coming\rfrom them enters our eyes. Eye is one\rof our most important sense organs. It\ris, therefore, important to understand\rits structure and working.\rThe eye has a roughly spherical\rshape. The outer coat of the eye is\rwhite. It is tough so that it can protect\rthe interior of the eye from accidents.\rIts transparent front part is called\rActivity 16.7\rFig. 16.13 : Dispersion of light\rGet a plane mirror of a suitable size.\rPlace it in a bowl (katori) as shown\rin Fig. 16.13. Fill the bowl with water.\rPut this arrangement near a window\rin such a way that direct sunlight\rfalls on the mirror. Adjust the\rposition of the bowl\rso that the reflected\rlight from the\rmirror falls on a\rwall. If the wall is\rnot white, fix a sheet\rof white paper on it.\rReflected light will\rbe seen to have\rmany colours. How\rcan you explain\rthis? The mirror\rand water form a\rprism. As you learnt in Class VII,\rthis breaks up the light into its\rcolours, Splitting of light into its\rcolours is known as dispersion of\rlight. Rainbow is a natural\rphenomenon showing dispersion.\r2015-16 (11-11-2014)\r206 SCIENCE\rFig. 16.15 : Demonstration of blind spot\rCaution : For this activity, never use\ra laser torch.\rActivity 16.8\rLook into your friend’s eye. Observe\rthe size of the pupil. Throw light on\rher eye with a torch. Observe the\rpupil now. Switch off the torch, and\robserve her pupil once again. Do\ryou notice any change in the size\rof the pupil? In which case was the\rpupil larger? Why do you think it\rwas so?\rIn which case do you need to\rallow more light in the eye, when\rthe light is dim or bright?\rBehind the pupil of the eye is a lens\rwhich is thicker in the centre. What\rkind of lens is thicker at the centre?\rRecall what you learnt about lenses in\rcornea (Fig. 16.14). Behind the cornea,\rwe find a dark muscular structure\rcalled iris. In the iris, there is a small\ropening called the pupil. The size of\rthe pupil is controlled by the iris. The\riris is that part of eye which gives it its\rdistinctive colour. When we say that a\rperson has green eyes, we refer actually\rto the colour of the iris. The iris controls\rthe amount of light entering into the\reye. Let us see how.\rIris\rLens\rCiliary\rmuscle\rCornea\rRetina\rOptic\rNerve\rFig. 16.14 : Human eye\rClass VII. The lens focuses light on the\rback of the eye, on a layer called retina\r(Fig. 16.14). The retina contains several\rnerve cells. Sensations felt by the nerve\rcells are then transmitted to the brain\rthrough the optic nerve.\rThere are two kinds of cells–\r(i) cones, which are sensitive to bright\rlight and\r(ii) rods, which are sensitive to dim light.\rCones sense colour. At the junction\rof the optic nerve and the retina, there\rare no sensory cells, so no vision is\rpossible at that spot. This is called the\rblind spot. Its existence can be\rdemonstrated as follows:\rActivity 16.9\rMake a round mark and a cross on\ra sheet of paper with the spot to the\rright of the cross (Fig. 16.15). The\rdistance between two marks may be\r6-8 cm. Hold the sheet of paper at\ran arm’s length from the eye. Close\ryour left eye. Look continuously at\rthe cross. Move the sheet slowly\rtowards you, keeping your eye on\rthe cross. What do you find? Does\rthe round mark disappear at some\rpoint? Now close your right eye.\rLook at the round mark now and\rrepeat the activity. Does the cross\rdisappear? The disappearance of the\rcross or the round mark shows that\rthere is a point on the retina which\rcannot send messages to the brain\rwhen light falls on it.\r2015-16 (11-11-2014)\rLIGHT 207\rNature has provided eyes with\reyelids to prevent any object from\rentering the eye. Eyelids also shut out\rlight when not required.\rEye is such a wonderful instrument\rthat it (normal) can clearly see distant\robjects as well as objects nearby. The\rminimum distance at which the eye can\rsee objects distinctly varies with age. The\rmost comfortable distance at which one\rcan read with a normal eye is about\r25 cm.\rSome persons can see objects close\rto them clearly but cannot see distant\robjects so clearly. On the other hand,\rsome persons cannot see objects close\rby clearly but they can see distant\robjects quite well. With suitable\rcorrective lenses, these defects of the\reye can be corrected.\rSometimes, particularly in old age,\reyesight becomes foggy. It is due to the\reye lens becoming cloudy. When it\rhappens, persons are said to have\rcataract. There is a loss of vision,\rsometimes extremely severe. It is\rpossible to treat this defect. The opaque\rlens is removed and a new artificial\rlens is inserted. Modern technology\rhas made this procedure simpler\rand safer.\r16.8 Care of the Eyes\rIt is necessary that you take proper care\rof your eyes. If there is any problem\ryou should go to an eye specialist. Have\ra regular checkup—\rl If advised, use suitable spectacles.\rl Too little or too much light is bad\rfor eyes. Insufficient light causes\reyestrain and headaches. Too much\rlight, like that of the sun, a powerful\rThe movies that we see are actually\ra number of separate pictures in\rproper sequence.

It\rpersists there for about 1/16th of a\rsecond.

Do not read by bringing\rthe book too close to your eyes or\rkeeping it too far.\rYou learnt about balanced diet in\rClass VI. If food is deficient in some\rcomponents, eyes may also suffer. Lack\rof vitamin A in foodstuff is responsible\rfor many eye troubles. Most common\ramongst them is night blindness.\rOne should, therefore, include in the\rdiet components which have vitamin A.\rDid you know?\rAnimals have eyes shaped in different ways. Eyes of a crab are quite small but\rthey enable the crab to look all around. So, the crab can sense even if the enemy\rapproaches from behind. Butterflies have large eyes that seem to be made up of\rthousands of little eyes (Fig.\r16.17). They can see not only in\rthe front and the sides but the\rback as well.\rA night bird (owl) can see very\rwell in the night but not during\rthe day. On the other hand, day\rlight birds (kite, eagle) can see\rwell during the day but not in the\rnight. The owl has a large cornea\rand a large pupil to allow more\rlight in its eye. Also, it has on its\rretina a large number of rods and\ronly a few cones. The day birds\ron the other hand, have more\rcones and fewer rods.\rFig. 16.17 : Eyes of a butterfly\rEyes\rRaw carrots, broccoli and green\rvegetables (such as spinach) and cod\rliver oil are rich in vitamin A. Eggs,\rmilk, curd, cheese, butter and fruits\rsuch as papaya and mango are also rich\rin vitamin A.\r16.9 Visually Challenged\rPersons Can Read and\rWrite\rSome persons, including children, can\rbe visually handicapped. They have very\rlimited vision to see things. Some\rpersons cannot see at all since birth.\rSome persons may lose their eyesight\rbecause of a disease. Such persons try\rto identify things by touching and\rlistening to voices more carefully. They\rdevelop their other senses more sharply.\rHowever, additional resources can\renable them to develop their capabilities\rfurther.\r2015-16 (11-11-2014)\rLIGHT 209\r16.10 What is the Braille\rSystem?\rThe most popular resource for visually\rchallenged persons is Braille.\rLouis Braille\rLouis Braille, himself a visually\rchallenged person, developed a\rsystem for visually challenged persons\rand published it in 1821.\rResources can be of two types : Non-optical aids and optical aids.\rNon-optical aids include visual aids, tactual aids (using the sense of touch),\rauditory aids (using the sense of hearing) and electronic aids. Visual aids, can\rmagnify words, can provide suitable intensity of light and material at proper distances.\rTactual aids, including Braille writer slate and stylus, help the visually challenged\rpersons in taking notes, reading and writing. Auditory aids include cassettes, tape\rrecorders, talking books and other such devices. Electronic aids, such as talking\rcalculators, are also available for performing many computational tasks. Closed\rcircuit television, also an electronic aid, enlarges printed material with suitable\rcontrast and illumination. Nowadays, use of audio CDs and voice boxes with\rcomputers are also very helpful for listening to and writing the desired text.\rOptical aids include bifocal lenses, contact lenses, tinted lenses, magnifiers\rand telescopic aids. While the lens combinations are used to rectify visual\rlimitations, telescopic aids are available to view chalkboard and class\rdemonstrations.\rFig. 16.18 : Example of dot patterns used\rin Braille System\rBraille system has 63 dot patterns or\rcharacters. Each character\rrepresents a letter, a combination of\rletters, a common word or a\rgrammatical sign. Dots are arranged\rin cells of two vertical rows of three\rdots each.\rPatterns of dots to represent some\rEnglish letters and some common\rwords are shown below.\rThese patterns when embossed on\rBraille sheets help visually\rchallenged persons to recognise words\rby touching. To make them easier to\rtouch, the dots are raised slightly.\rThe present system was adopted in\r1932. There is Braille code for common\rlanguages, mathematics and scientific\rnotation. Many Indian languages can\rbe read using the Braille system.\r2015-16 (11-11-2014)\r210 SCIENCE\rSome visually challenged Indians have great achievements to their\rcredit. Diwakar, a child prodigy has given amazing performances\ras a singer.\rRavindra Jain, born completely visually challenged, obtained\rhis Sangeet Prabhakar degree from Allahabad. He has shown his\rexcellence as a lyricist, singer and music composer.\rLal Advani, himself visually challenged, established an\rAssociation for special education and rehabilitation of disabled\rin India. Besides this, he represented India on Braille problems\rin UNESCO.\rHelen A. Keller, an American author and lecturer, is perhaps the most wellknown and inspiring visually challenged person. She lost her sight when she was\ronly 18 months old. But because of her resolve and courage she could complete\rher graduation from a university. She wrote a number of books including The\rStory of my Life (1903).\rHelen A.

In this game a person isblind-folded and has to catch theremaining players. How is the blind-folded person able to guess which playeris closest to her?Sound plays an important role in ourlife. It helps us to communicate with oneanother. We hear a variety of sounds inour surroundings.Make a list of sounds you hear inyour surroundings.In the music room of your school youhear the sounds made by musicalinstruments like flute, tabla,harmonium etc. (Fig 13.1).How is sound produced? How does ittravel from one place to another? Howdo we hear sound? Why are some soundslouder than others? We shall discusssuch questions in this chapter.Fig. 13.1 : Some musical instrumentsTablaHarmoniumSitarFlute© NCERTnot to be republishedSCIENCE16013.1 Sound is Produced by aVibrating BodyTouch the school bell when not in use.What do you feel? Again touch it whenproducing sound. Can you feel itvibrating?Activity 13.1Take a metal plate (or a shallowfrying pan). Hang it at a convenientplace in such a way that it does nottouch any wall. Now strike it with astick (Fig.13.2). Touch the plate orpan gently with your finger. Do youfeel the vibrations?Fig. 13.2 : Striking a frying panAgain strike the plate with the stickand hold it tightly with your handsimmediately after striking. Do youstill hear the sound? Touch theplate after it stops producing sound.Can you feel the vibrations now?The to and fro or back and forthmotion of an object is termed asvibration as you learnt in Class VII.When a tightly stretched band isplucked, it vibrates and producessound. When it stops vibrating, it doesnot produce any sound.Activity 13.3Take a metal dish. Pour water in it.Strike it at its edge by a spoon (Fig.13.4). Do you hear a sound? Againstrike the plate and then touch it.Can you feel the dish vibrating?Strike the dish again. Look at thesurface of water. Do you see anywaves there? Now hold the dish.What change do you observe on thesurface of water? Can you explainthe change? Is there a hint toconnect sound with the vibrationsof a body?Activity 13.2Take a rubber band. Put it aroundthe longer side of a pencil box(Fig. 13.3). Insert two pencilsbetween the box and the stretchedrubber. Now, pluck the rubber bandsomewhere in the middle. Do youhear any sound? Does the bandvibrate?Fig. 13.3 : Plucking the rubber band© NCERTnot to be republishedSOUND161We see that a vibrating objectproduces sound. In some cases, thevibrations are easily visible to us. Butin most cases, their amplitude is so smallthat we cannot see them. However, wecan feel them.Activity 13.4Take a hollow coconut shell andmake a musical instrument Ektara.You can also make it with the helpof an earthen pot (Fig. 13.5).

Put your hand onyour throat as shown in Fig. 13.8. Doyou feel any vibrations?In humans, the sound is producedby the voice box or the larynx. Put yourfingers on the throat and find a hardbump that seems to move when youswallow. This part of the body is knownas the voice box. It is at the upper endof the windpipe. Two vocal cords, arestretched across the voice box or larynxin such a way that it leaves a narrowslit between them for the passage of air(Fig.13.8).Fig. 13.7 : JaltrangWhen we pluck the string of aninstrument, like the sitar, the soundthat we hear is not only that of thestring. The whole instrument is forcedto vibrate, and it is the sound of thevibration of the instrument that wehear. Similarly, when we strike themembrane of a mridangam, the soundthat we hear is not only that of themembrane but of the whole body ofthe instrument.When we speak, doesany part of our bodyvibrate?Fig.13.8 : Voice box in humansWhen the lungs force air through theslit, the vocal cords vibrate, producingsound. Muscles attached to the vocalcords can make the cords tight or loose.When the vocal cords are tight and thin,the type or quality of voice is differentActivity 13.5Take 6-8 metal bowls or tumblers.Fill them with water up to  differentlevels, increasing gradually fromone end to the other. Now takea  pencil and strike the bowls gently.Strike all of them in succession. Youwill hear a pleasant sound. This isyour Jaltrang (Fig.13.7).© NCERTnot to be republishedSOUND163from that when they are loose andthick. Let us see how the vocal cordsfunction.Activity 13.6Take two rubber strips of the samesize. Place these two pieces oneabove the other and stretch themtight. Now blow air through the gapbetween them [Fig. 13.9(a)]. As theair blows through the stretchedrubber strips, a sound is produced.You can also take a piece of paperwith a narrow slit and hold itbetween your fingers as shown inFig. 13.9 (b). Now blow through theslit and listen to the sound. Ourvocal cords produce sound in asimilar manner.(a)(b)Fig. 13.9 (a), (b) : Working of vocal cordsThe vocal cords in men are about20mm long. In women these are about5mm shorter. Children have veryshort vocal cords. This is the reasonwhy the voices of men, women andchildren are different.13.3 Sound Needs a Mediumfor PropagationWhen you call up your friend who isstanding at a distance, your friend isable to hear your voice. How does thesound travel to her?Activity 13.7Take a metal glass tumbler. Makesure that it is dry. Place a cell phonein it. (Remember that the cell phonemust not be kept in water.) Ask yourfriend to give a ring on this cellphone from another cell phone.Listen to the ring carefully.Now, surround the rim of thetumbler with your hands (Fig.13.10). Put your mouth on theFig. 13.10 : Sound needs a medium to travel© NCERTnot to be republishedSCIENCE164Place your ear gently on the watersurface (Fig. 13.11). (Be careful :water should not enter in your ear).Can you hear the sound of the bell?Does it indicate that sound cantravel through liquids?opening between your hands.Indicate to your friend to give a ringagain. Listen to the ring whilesucking air from the tumbler.Does the sound become fainteras you suck?Remove the tumbler from yourmouth. Does the sound becomeloud again?Can you think of an explanation? Isit possible that the decreasing amountof air in the tumbler had something todo with decreasing loudness of the ring?Indeed, if you had been able to suckall the air in the tumbler, the sound wouldstop completely. Actually, sound needs amedium to travel. When air has beenremoved completely from a vessel, it is saidthat there is vacuum in the vessel. Thesound  cannot travel through vacuum.Does sound travel in liquids? Let usfind out.Activity 13.8Take a bucket or a bathtub. Fill itwith clean water. Take a small bellin one hand. Shake this bell insidethe water to produce sound. Makesure that the bell does not touchthe body of the bucket or the tub.Oh ! That is how whalesand dolphins might becommunicating underwater.Fig. 13.11 : Sound travelling through waterFig. 13.12 : Sound travelling through a me-tre scaleCan you hear the sound of thescratch? Ask your friends aroundyou if they were able to hear thesame sound?Let us find out if sound can travelthrough solids also.Activity 13.9Take a metre scale or a long metalrod and hold its one end to yourear. Ask your friend to gentlyscratch or tap the other end of thescale (Fig. 13.12).© NCERTnot to be republishedSOUND165You can also perform the aboveactivity by placing your ear at one endof a long wooden or metallic table andasking your friend to gently scratch theother end of the table (Fig. 13.13).Fig. 13.13 : Sound can travel through solidsWe find that sound can travelthrough wood or metal. In fact, soundcan travel through any solid. You canperform interesting activities to showthat sound can also travel throughstrings. Recall if you made a toytelephone (Fig. 13.14). Can you say thatthe sound can travel through strings?Fig. 13.14 : A toy telephoneWe have learnt so far that vibratingobjects produce sound and it is carriedin all directions in a medium. How dowe hear it?13.4 We hear Sound throughOur EarsThe shape of the outer part of the ear islike a funnel. When sound enters in it,it travels down a canal at the end ofwhich a thin membrane is stretchedtightly. It is called the eardrum. Itperforms an important function. Tounderstand what the eardrum does, letus build a tin can model of the eardrum.Activity 13.10Take a tin can. Cut its ends. Stretcha piece of rubber balloon across oneend of the can and fasten it with arubber band. Put four or five grainsof dry cereal on the stretched rubber.Now ask your friend to speak“Hurrey, Hurrey” from the open end(Fig.13.15). Observe what  happensto the grain. Why do the grainsjump up and down?Fig. 13.15 : Tin can eardrum© NCERTnot to be republishedSCIENCE166The eardrum is like a stretchedrubber sheet. Sound vibrations makethe eardrum vibrate (Fig. 13.16). Theeardrum sends vibrations to the innerear. From there, the signal goes to thebrain. That is how we hear.You have already learnt in earlier classesabout the oscillatory motion and itstime period.The number of oscillations persecond is called the frequency ofoscillation. Frequency is expressed inhertz. Its symbol is Hz. A frequency of1 Hz is one oscillation per second. If anobject oscillates 20 times in one second,what would be its frequency?You can recognise many familiarsounds without seeing the objectsproducing them. How is it possible?These sounds must be different toenable you to recognise them. Have youever thought what factors make themdifferent?  Amplitude and frequency aretwo important properties of any sound.Can we differentiate sounds on the basisof their amplitudes and frequencies?Loudness and PitchActivity 13.11Take a metallic tumbler and atablespoon. Strike the tablespoongently at the brim of the tumbler.Fig. 13.16 : Human earFig. 13.17 : Thermocole ball touching thevibrating glass tumblerWe must NEVER put a sharp,pointed or hard thing into ourear. It can damage theeardrum. The damagedeardrum can impair hearing.13.5 Amplitude, Time PeriodAnd Frequency Of AVibrationWe have learnt that the to and fro motionof an object is known as vibration. Thismotion is also called oscillatory motion.Eardrum© NCERTnot to be republishedSOUND167Hear the sound produced. Now bangthe spoon on the tumbler and hearthe sound produced again. Is thesound louder when the tumbler isstruck hard?Now suspend a small thermocoleball touching the rim of the tumbler(Fig. 13.17). Vibrate the tumbler bystriking it. See how far the ball isdisplaced. The displacement of theball is a measure of the amplitudeof vibration of the tumbler.Now, strike the tumbler gentlyand then with some force. Comparethe amplitudes of vibrations of thetumbler in the two cases. In whichcase is the amplitude larger?Loudness of sound is proportional tothe square of the amplitude of thevibration producing the sound. Forexample, if the amplitude becomestwice, the loudness increases by afactor of 4. The loudness is expressedin a unit called decibel (dB). Thefollowing table gives some idea of theloudness of sound coming fromvarious sources.Normal breathing10 dBSoft whisper (at 5m)30 dBNormal conversation60 dBBusy traffic70 dBAverage factory80 dBAbove 80 dB the noise becomesphysically painful.I wonder why my voiceis different from that ofmy teacher.Compare the sound of a baby withthat of an adult. Is there any difference?Even if two sounds are equally loud,they differ in some way. Let us see how.Fig. 13.18 : Frequency determines thepitch of a soundThe loudness of sound depends onits amplitude. When the amplitude ofvibration is large, the sound producedis loud. When the amplitude is small,the sound produced is feeble.The frequency determines theshrillness or pitch of a sound. If thefrequency of vibration is higher we saythat the sound is shrill and has a higherpitch. If the frequency of vibration islower, we say that the sound has a lowerpitch. For example, a drum vibrates witha low frequency. Therefore, it produces© NCERTnot to be republishedSCIENCE168a low-pitched sound. On the otherhand, a whistle has a high frequencyand therefore, produces a sound ofhigher pitch (Fig. 13.18). A bird makesa high-pitched sound whereas a lionmakes a low-pitched roar. However, theroar of a lion is very loud while thesound of the bird is quite feeble.Every day you hear the voices ofchildren and adults. Do you find anydifference in their voices? Can you saythat the frequency of the voice of a childis higher than that of an adult? Usuallythe voice of a woman has a higherfrequency and is shriller than that of aman.13.6 Audible and InaudibleSoundsWe know that we need a vibrating bodyfor the production of sound. Can wehear the sound of all vibrating bodies?The fact is that sounds of frequenciesless than about 20 vibrations per second(20 Hz) cannot be detected by the  humanear. Such sounds are called inaudible.On the higher side, sounds of  frequencieshigher than about 20,000 vibrations persecond (20 kHz) are also not audible tothe  human ear. Thus, for human ear,the range of audible frequencies isroughly from 20 to 20,000 Hz.Some animals can hear sounds offrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.Dogs have this ability. The police usehigh frequency whistles which dogs canhear but humans cannot.The ultrasound equipment, familiarto us for investigating and trackingmany medical problems, works atfrequencies higher than 20,000 Hz.13.7 Noise and MusicWe hear different types of soundsaround us. Is the sound alwayspleasing? Does a sound sometimescause discomfort to you? Some soundsare pleasant to the ear, whereas someare not.Suppose construction work is goingon in your neighbourhood. Are thesounds coming from the constructionsite pleasing? Do you enjoy the soundsproduced by horns of buses and trucks?Such unpleasant sounds are callednoise. In a classroom, if all the studentsspeak together, what would the soundproduced be called?On the other hand you enjoy soundsfrom musical instruments. Musicalsound is one which is pleasing to theear. Sound produced by a harmoniumis a musical sound. The string of a sitaralso gives out a musical sound.  But, ifa musical sound becomes too loud,would it remain melodious?13.8 Noise PollutionYou already know about air pollution.Presence of unwanted gases andparticles in air is called air pollution.Similarly, presence of excessive orunwanted sounds in the environmentis called noise pollution. Can you listsome sources of noise pollution? Majorcauses of noise pollution are sounds ofvehicles, explosions including burstingof crackers, machines, loudspeakers etc.What sources in the home may lead tonoise? Television and transistor radioat high volumes, some kitchenappliances, desert coolers, airconditioners, all contribute to noisepollution.© NCERTnot to be republishedSOUND169Hearing ImpairmentThe total hearing imparment, which is rare, is usually from birth itself. Partialdisability is generally the result of a disease, injury or age. Children with impairedhearing need special care. By learning sign language, such children cancommunicate effectively. Because speech develops as the direct result of hearing,a child with a hearing loss may have defective speech also. Technological devicesfor the hearing-impared have made it possible for such persons to improve theirquality of life. Society can do much to  improve the living environment for thehearing-impaired and help them live normal lives.What are the harms of noisepollution?Do you know that presence ofexcessive noise in the surroundings maycause many health related problems.Lack of sleep, hypertension (high blood-pressure), anxiety and many more healthdisorders may be caused by noisepollution. A person who is exposed to aloud sound continuously may gettemporary or even permanentimpairment of hearing.Measures to Limit Noise PollutionTo control noise, we  must control thesources of noise. How can this beachieved? For this, silencing devicesmust be installed in air craft engines,transport vehicles, industrialmachines and home appliances.How can the noise pollution becontrolled in a residential area?The noisy operations must beconducted away from any residentialarea. Noise producing industriesshould be set up away from suchareas. Use of automobile hornsshould be minimised. TV and musicsystems should be run at lowvolumes. Trees must be planted alongthe roads and around buildings tocut down on the sounds reaching theresidents, thus reducing the harmfuleffects of noise pollution.© NCERTnot to be republishedSCIENCE170 KEYWORDSAMPLITUDEAUDIBLEEARDRUMHERTZ (Hz)LARYNXLOUDNESSNOISEOSCILLATIONPITCHSHRILLNESSTIME PERIODVIBRATIONVOICE BOXWIND PIPE WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT\u0001Sound is produced by vibrating objects.\u0001In human beings, the vibration of the vocalcords produces sound.\u0001Sound travels through a medium (gas, liquidor solid).
